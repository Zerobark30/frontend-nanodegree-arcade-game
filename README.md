===============================

Welcome to Bugger!

In order to play the game, simply clone the repository and run the index.html
file from your favorite browser (I put this together in Google Chrome, so that might work best). From there you should be placed on the start screen where you can select the game difficulty and press enter to move on to the game.

Enjoy!
